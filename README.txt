First make sure all the files are included:
	addresses.txt
	BACKING_STORE.bin
	VM.c
	VM.h
	makefile

If all files exist make sure you clean the folder first - just in case:
	make clean

Then type:
	make

Now the executible will appear as 'virtmem' -> to run it type:
	./virtmem BACKING_STORE.bin addresses.txt
